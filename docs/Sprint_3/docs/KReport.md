# [Sprint 3] Contributions to the Common Knowledge Base - GastroStock (Group 2)

In this file we will present the whole of our contribution to the CKB. The Common Knowledge Base is accessible at https://bcc2425.vercel.app/ and you can check its development in the GitHub repository at https://github.com/ISPP-2425/BCC .

None of our feedback was relevant to other groups, and thus we had nothing to contribute to the Common Knowledge Base that was not already there.

We received feedback about group cohession and the importance of retalliation when it comes to those who do not add to the project. All of it was already in the CKB and thus, no contributions were added.
