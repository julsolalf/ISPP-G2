# [Sprint 1] Commitment Agreement of Pilot Users - GastroStock (Group 2)

During this Sprint 1, no task were scheduled to any Pilot Users other than accepting the official methods of communication of GastroStock and verbally agreeing to perform their tasks in the future. In that note, all of them scored a 10 out of 10, we could not be happier to have them.
