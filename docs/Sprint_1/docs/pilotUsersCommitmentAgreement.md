# [Sprint 1] Commitment Agreement of Pilot Users - GastroStock (Group 2)

Being that no tasks were required by the Pilot Users, no written commitment agreement was signed.

However all of them were contacted through the official methods of communication and verbally agreed to perform their tasks when asked to do so in the future.
